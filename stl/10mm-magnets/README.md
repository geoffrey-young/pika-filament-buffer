# 10x3mm magnet support

as discussed in [a note on magnets...](../../README.md#a-note-on-magnets) in the [README](../../README.md), true 10x3mm disc magnets are a rare find in the wild.  however, if you happen to get some below are the files you'll need.

please print the [disc magnet test blocks](./magnet-test-blocks.stl) and test fit your magnets before printing actual parts.
